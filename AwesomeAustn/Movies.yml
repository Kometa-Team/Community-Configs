    summary: The ability to travel through time is by far my favorite movie story line. Who hasn"t, at least once in their lifetime, wished they could turn back the hands of time to buy a winning lottery ticket or to set something right that once went wrong? The movies listed below have a wide range of inventive ways on how the subjects are moved across time. Many of these films use either a mental ability, a magical device or time machine, some seem to have help from a higher power, and sometimes the person just wakes up in a different time. If you love TV shows like Outlander, Timeless, Doctor Who or Quantum Leap, then this list of the best time-traveling films is for you. -rlhron

  Action:
    template: {name: IMDb Genres, genre: action}
    summary: Action film is a genre wherein physical action takes precedence in the storytelling. The film will often have continuous motion and action including physical stunts, chases, fights, battles, and races. The story usually revolves around a hero that has a goal, but is facing incredible odds to obtain it.
  Animation:
    template: {name: IMDb Genres, genre: animation}
    summary: Animated film is a collection of illustrations that are photographed frame-by-frame and then played in a quick succession. Since its inception, animation has had a creative and imaginative tendency. Being able to bring animals and objects to life, this genre has catered towards fairy tales and childrenâ€™s stories. However, animation has long been a genre enjoyed by all ages. As of recent, there has even been an influx of animation geared towards adults.
