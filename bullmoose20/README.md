# bullmoose20 PMM files
## Basics
I run PMM nightly (not lsio image) and Plex(hotio image) on Unraid 6.12.6. At the top of my config.yml file I will usually specify the version that this config.yml file works with.

<br>

## Instructions
Take what you need from my config.yml. I run everything stock from the github default PMM and tweak from within my config.yml to "make it my own". If you perform a straight copy, search for `(redacted)` as you will need to replace that with your own information. Search for `db_cache` which is for Plex and now available to set via PMM. I use 2048 MB (2GB) as my system has 168 GB of RAM. You will want to improve it from the default 40 MB that Plex sets. Maybe a good starting point if you have enough RAM is 1024 MB which is 1GB.

If you want to set the language file to something other than fr (french) do not forget to make that change to `language: fr` lines in the config.yml file before running. As for the `placeholder_imdb_id:` ensure that you read and understand those lines as you may need to choose your own **Movie** or **TV Show** as your library may not have the two references that I have.

Nothing is local other than the fonts which are included in this repo (fonts.zip). These fonts are the best match I could find per ratings site and the ratings overlays. 

Unzip the fonts into `config/metadata/overlays/fonts/` to use this config without modifications.

You can put the fonts elsewhere, but if you choose to do that, you will need to adjust the ratings section (rating1_font:, rating2_font:, rating3_font:) of the overlays within the config.yml file to point to the location you chose.

I also prefer to have a copy of the local assets so that if I need to recover to the original posters, they are there. I use grab-all-posters.py from chazlarson's repo to help with that: https://github.com/chazlarson/Media-Scripts/tree/main/Plex-Meta-Manager and the following in my .env:
