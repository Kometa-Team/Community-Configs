## Basics
I run PMM nightly (not lsio image) and Plex(hotio image) within Unraid:

## Instructions
Take what you need from my config.yml. I run everything stock from the github default PMM and tweak from within my config.yml to "make it my own". If you perform a straight copy, search for `(redacted)` as you will need to replace that with your own information.

Nothing is local other than the fonts which are included in this repo (fonts.zip). These fonts are the best match I could find per ratings site and the ratings overlays. 

Unzip the fonts into `config/metadata/overlays/fonts/` to use this config without modifications.

You can put the fonts elsewhere, but if you choose to do that, you will need to adjust the ratings section (rating1_font:, rating2_font:, rating2_font:) of the overlays within the config.yml file to point to the location you chose.

Feel free to ask me questions in the PMM Discord channel.
