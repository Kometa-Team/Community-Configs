# Configs
I wanted to try and make things as 'drag and drop' as possible for people who like things to be more modular than the large, monolithic configs some people put together. Each individual config file is atomic, in the sense that it contains one collection, one movie series, or similar along with matching posters for each item in the collection.

In order to best use these, you can use a `folder:` tag in your config file for each library pointed to the directory you place them in.

Each config file uses a complete set of matching posters, and collection poster, all of which are linked in the config file itself. If you want to change the poster set, just change the links in your config.

I've also included a config file which I use as a base for all of these. If you want to create your own structure, just copy the contents of the config file into your yml, and fill out the fields

##### Future Collections
Some future collections I plan to do include:

There are a lot of good collections for these already, but my aim is to include matching posters for them as well in the provided files, which most don't do.
