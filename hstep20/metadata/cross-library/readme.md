# Note
Cross Library configs are configs for items that contain both TV Show and Movies in the config. 

### Attenborough Documentary Notes

There are two separate versions of the config file. The only difference is that one uses the "**Orb**" Poster set for the Planet Collection, and one uses the "**Normal**" Poster set for the Planet Collection. Everything else is the same

- Orb Posters: https://theposterdb.com/set/143160
- Normal Posters: https://theposterdb.com/poster/238214

You can pick whichever set you prefer (personally, I use the Orbs)
