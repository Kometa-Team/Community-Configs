# CptNeptun PMM Config Files

These are my config files for [Plex-Meta-Manager (PMM)](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager).

## Basics
I run PMM nightly. Make sure to have at least version 1.19.1-develop62.

### Included

* config.yml -> PMM Config File
* money_heist.yml -> Metadata for the show "Money Heist (2017)" in Netflix Order
* movies.yml -> Movie Collections
* playlists.yml -> Playlists
* tv.yml -> TV Show Collections

All files are available in German (DE) and English (EN). Feel free to ask me questions via Discord or make suggestions on what I need to add here.

## Install

Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/itsFelixH/pmm-config
```

## Usage:

Setup PMM & create your config file . For help refer to the [PMM Wiki](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/index.html).

If setup, run:

## Additional Information

For PMM related questions or issues, join the [PMM Discord Server](https://discord.gg/uvXgYS73Qf).

You can find all posters I used on [The Poster Database](https://theposterdb.com/).

I also use [PATTRMM (Plex Assistant To The Regional Meta Manager)](https://github.com/InsertDisc/pattrmm) for better tv show status banners.
