# THIS DIRECTORY HAS BEEN ARCHIVED

As of v1.18.0, the PMM Defaults are baked directly into the [Plex Meta Manager image](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager/tree/master/defaults) and are no longer held in the Configs repository. 

**You can continue using all other folders and files within the repository, those are unaffected by this change.**

As part of this change, any reference to `- git: PMM/...` within your config.yml is automatically redirected to the new `- pmm:` directory, which you can find [HERE](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager/tree/master/defaults).

For guidance on using the PMM Defaults, we suggest reading the [Defaults Usage Guide](https://metamanager.wiki/en/nightly/defaults/guide.html)

Please consider [donating](https://github.com/sponsors/meisnate12) towards the project.
