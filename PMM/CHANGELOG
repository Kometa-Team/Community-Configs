# OTHER CHANGES
Changed various [template names](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager-Configs/blob/master/PMM/templates.yml). If you are running local copies of the PMM default files which call the git version of the templates file , it is strongly recommended you check template names on all your local file collections.
