**Single Instance** (Simple Setup)

If you are using a single instance of Kometa - Copy everything in ```Plex-Meta-Manager-All``` to your docker container location and edit the config.yml to match your settings. Then run the container, open a terminal window, and use the following command ```python kometa.py -r```


**Multiple Instances** (Advanced Setup)

The way I have my Kometa setup is via mutiple docker containers in Unraid. I have one for **Anime**, **Movies**, and **TV Shows**. The reason this was done was to speed up the process for each main category. On smaller collections this may not be as necessarily, however for larger collections like mine this is a must. To set them up copy ```Plex-Meta-Manager-Anime```, ```Plex-Meta-Manager-Movies```, and ```Plex-Meta-Manager-TV``` to their each own docker container location and edit the config.yml in each to match your settings. To run the containers, open a terminal window for each, and use the following command ```python kometa.py -r```
