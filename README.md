This repo contains community-sourced configurations.

They are, **for the most part**, not maintained, warranted, or tested by the Kometa team.

There are **some** in here which are supplied and maintained by members of the Kometa team on their own, but, overall, maintenance of these configs is the individual responsibility of the people supplying them.

They may or may not:
1. do what you want
2. work at all
3. cause data loss
4. kick your puppy

If you use anything in this repo, you are taking sole responsibility for that decision.
