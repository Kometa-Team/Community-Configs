This is my Kometa Config - heavily inspired by WhoDat104 and bullmoose20 and probably a bajillion other people. Thanks!

movies_subgenre, movies_topics, tvshows_documentaries & tvshows_topics don't create collections, but tag items for use with the default genre collection.

Posters are (slowly) being made for collections using the Create Poster script by bullmoose20 https://github.com/bullmoose20/Plex-Stuff#create_poster
