    summary: "The Universal Studios' The Mummy franchise began in 1932 with the release of the original film, which starred Boris Karloff as the titular mummy, Imhotep. The film follows an archaeologist who accidentally revives Imhotep, who then seeks to resurrect his long-lost love. The film was a critical and commercial success, leading to several sequels and spin-offs.

In 1940, Universal released The Mummy's Hand, which introduced a new mummy, Kharis, and a new set of characters. This film was followed by several sequels, including The Mummy's Tomb, The Mummy's Ghost, and The Mummy's Curse. In 1955, Universal released Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy, a comedic crossover film that featured the popular comedy duo encountering Kharis and other classic Universal monsters.

The franchise was later rebooted in 1999 with a new film starring Brendan Fraser, which was a box office success and spawned two sequels and a spin-off film. The 1999 film follows adventurer Rick O'Connell as he and a team of archaeologists accidentally awaken the mummy of Imhotep, who seeks to resurrect his lover and destroy the world. The film was praised for its action sequences and special effects, and helped to revive interest in the classic Universal monsters.

In 2017, Universal attempted to reboot the franchise again with a new film starring Tom Cruise and Sofia Boutella. The film was intended to launch a shared universe of monster films known as the Dark Universe, but it was a critical and commercial failure. The film follows Nick Morton, a soldier who accidentally awakens the mummy of Princess Ahmanet, who seeks to use him as a vessel for the god Set. Despite the star power of Cruise and Boutella, the film was criticized for its lack of scares and confusing plot. The failure of the Dark Universe led to the cancellation of several planned films, including a Bride of Frankenstein remake."
