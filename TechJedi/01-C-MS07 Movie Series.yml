    summary: "The Airport series of films is a collection of disaster films that were produced in the 1970s. The first film in the series, Airport, was released in 1970 and was based on the novel of the same name by Arthur Hailey. The film was a huge success and spawned three sequels: Airport 1975, Airport '77, and The Concorde... Airport '79. The films all follow a similar formula, with a group of passengers and crew members facing a life-threatening crisis while on board a commercial airliner.

In Airport, the crisis is a bomb on board the plane, while in Airport 1975, the plane collides with a small private plane, causing damage to the cockpit and killing the pilots. In Airport '77, the plane crashes into the ocean and sinks to the bottom, trapping the passengers and crew inside. Finally, in The Concorde... Airport '79, the plane is targeted by terrorists who plan to blow it up mid-flight. Each film features a star-studded cast, including actors such as Burt Lancaster, Charlton Heston, and Jack Lemmon.

Despite their formulaic plots, the Airport films were hugely popular with audiences in the 1970s. They capitalized on the public's fascination with air travel and the fear of flying, as well as the growing interest in disaster films. The films also paved the way for other disaster films of the era, such as The Towering Inferno and Earthquake. While the Airport series may seem dated by today's standards, they remain a classic example of the disaster film genre and a testament to the power of Hollywood's ability to captivate audiences with thrilling and suspenseful stories."
